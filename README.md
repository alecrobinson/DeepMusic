# DeepMusic
generating music with neural networks

Based off of the repository at https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5, with transposition added to augment the available data. Since it's important for the model to learn relationships between all notes in a key, transposing every piece to every other key of its type will allow it to learn more.
